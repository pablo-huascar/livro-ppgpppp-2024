**Research and practice in Psychology and public policies** presents a series of investigations and actions developed within the Professional Graduate Program in Psychology and Public Policies at the Federal University of Ceará. This volume brings together chapters that contribute to understanding the social and cultural dynamics that permeate the experiences of marginalized populations and professionals working in the field of public policies. Through the articulation of teaching, research, and extension, the various works demonstrate how public universities can build networks of solidarity and forms of resistance in the face of inequalities in the interior of Northeast Brazil.

Throughout the book, the authors give visibility to the demands of different social groups and question the structures that perpetuate inequalities. In this way, it is possible to reflect on the role of psychology and public policies in building a more just and equitable society. Therefore, this book is an essential read for students, professionals, and researchers in psychology, social sciences, and public policies, as well as for anyone interested in understanding and transforming the social realities in which we live.
